Mai Solutions Cold Email Reach
Installation Instructions

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------
- Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit recommended)
- Architecture: 64-bit (x64) processor
- Disk Space: ~1 GB free space

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Run "ColdEmailReachSetup.exe".
2. If you see a "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen) warning:
   - Click "More info".
   - Click "Run anyway".
   (This appears because the installer is not digitally signed with a paid certificate).
3. Follow the installation wizard.
4. Shortcuts will be created on your Desktop and Start Menu.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- "Invalid PC Version" or "This app cannot run on your PC":
  This installation requires a 64-bit version of Windows. It will not run on 32-bit systems.

- "Invalid DOS" or Corruption on Copy:
  The executable is large (>500MB). Ensure your flash drive is formatted correctly (NTFS or exFAT recommended, though FAT32 should work) and verify line integrity. Try zipping the .exe file before multiple file transfers to ensure it doesn't get corrupted.
